Introduction
------------

This is a small simple configuration file utlity that wrap's Python 3's
own configparser. Support initialization files are assumed to be in
"ini" format and are associated with a support system like MySQL. Each
support configuration file provides two functions, FindConfig() and
ParseConfig(). FindConfig checks a series of path location for configuration
and returns the first one found or None if no config file is discovered.
ParseConfig takes the path from FindConfig and any additional optional
parameters associated with the  resource (e.g. a database name in MySQL)
and returns a dictionary of key/value parse.


Installation
------------

cfg is installable with Python setup.py. 

```
git clone git@github.com:caltechlibrary/cfg
cd cfg
python3 setup.py install
```

Usage
-----

Once installed this Python 3 package can be included using 
the standard `from cfg import ...` pattern. Here's an example
of installing it to return a configuration needed for a MySQL
connection.

```
import sys
from cfg import FindConfig, ParseConfig

my_cnf = FindConfig()
if my_cnf == None:
    print('Can't find my.cnf')
    sys.exit(1)
conf = ParseConfig(my_cnf, database = 'mydb')
if conf == None:
    print(f'''Can't parse {my_cnf}''')
    sys.exit(1)


```

Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

Currently supports searching in the current directory for a
"my.cnf" file or the user's home directory for ".my.cnf". Assumes
a Unix style file system (using path separate and dot prefix).
Does not current support looking for other types of configuration files.
